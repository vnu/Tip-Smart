# Tip-Smart - Smart Tip Calculator

### Tip Smart
A smart way to calculate your tip.
Based on my personal past tipping preference, the Tip smart has the following features

* Enter your bill to get the tip and total amount.  
* How was your service experience? Choose sad, meh and happy faces with default tips 15%, 18% and 20%.    
* The fourth question face is to add your custom tip.  
* Set the default service tip options and default service experience in the Settings page.  
* You can also round off your total bill to have that whole value in your credit card bills.  
* Split your bill with friends with a easy switch. 
* Split View has individual tip and individual total to make signing that final split check so easy.  
* Your last bill state is stored for 20 seconds for now.  
* Your total bill will show in your locale-specific currency. 


### Future Features
* Custom split defaults.  
* Custom time to store the last bill state.  
* Ability to easily share individual bills with friends through email and message.

### Installation & Testing Instructions
The app was developed for iPhone 5s. I did not set auto layouts or other size classes. 
I tested completely in portait mode.
